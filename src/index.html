      <h2>Geography</h2>
      <p>
        <img align="right" src="./About/Map.jpg" style="width: 20%;" />
        Covering a total area of about 1,399 km2, the Faroe Islands archipelago
        comprises 18 principal islands along with numerous small rocky islands
        and islets. Some of the major islands of the archipelago include Borðoy,
        Eysturoy, Sandoy, Streymoy, Suðuroy, Svínoy, and Vágar. Out of the 18
        main islands of the archipelago, 17 of these islands are inhabited while
        only the small Lítla Dímun island is uninhabited. Covering an area of
        373 km2, the oblong-shaped Streymoy Island is the biggest and the most
        populous in the Faroe Islands archipelago. Located on the southern edge
        of the Streymoy island is Tórshavn, the capital and main port of the
        Faroe Islands archipelago. Eysturoy is the second-largest island on the
        archipelago that covers an area of about 286.3 km2. The islands are
        further administratively divided into 29 municipalities that consist of
        more than 120 settlements.The Faroe Islands have rugged and rocky
        terrain and are mainly composed of basaltic lava. There are few small
        elevated peaks and the highly indented coast of the islands features
        several fjords that are further lined by numerous perpendicular cliffs.
        Located in the northern part of Eysturoy Island is Slættaratindur, which
        rises to an elevation of 882 m and is the highest point in the Faroe
        Island archipelago. There are few small rivers and minor lakes in the
        Faroe Islands archipelago. According to the Köppen climate
        classification, the Faroe Islands experiences a subpolar oceanic climate
        with mild winters and cool summers. The climate of the archipelago is
        strongly influenced by the warm North Atlantic Current, which helps to
        keep the harbors on the island ice-free throughout the year.

        At first sight, the Faroe Islands might give the impression of quite a
        uniform vegetation with no trees – only a tundra-like appearance. A
        closer look however, reveals surprising diversity. he fauna of the Faroe
        Islands reflects the islands’ remoteness, as there are few terrestrial
        species, but plenty of seabirds and marine animals. While humans have
        introduced all of the island’s land mammals, intentionally or otherwise,
        most of the birds and marine animals are endemic. When the ice melted
        after the last ice age, some 10-20.000 years ago, the islands were bare
        rocks with hardly any plants. But as the ice disappeared and the cliffs
        crumbled, plants started to grow and they spread. Some Arctic species
        such as “Mountain Poppy” and “Dwarf Cudweed” probably survived the last
        ice age on some ice-free mountaintops (nunataks), but the majority of
        plants growing in the Faroe Islands today arrived after the ice age. The
        vegetation of the Faroe Islands archipelago is dominated by grass,
        wildflowers, moss, arctic-alpine plants, and lichen. Due to the strong
        westerly winds and frequent gales that are faced by the archipelago, the
        Faroe Islands are mostly treeless although a few hardy trees have
        recently been introduced in the sheltered plantations of the islands.
        Numerous avian species are found on the Faroe Islands. These include the
        various species of seabirds, common starling, common murre, common
        eider, Atlantic puffins, Eurasian wren, and the black guillemot. Few
        terrestrial animals are found here including the mountain hare, brown
        rat, house mouse, Faroe sheep, Faroe cow, and Faroe pony. Several
        cetacean species are recorded in the waters surrounding the Faroe
        Islands. Grey seals and long-finned pilot whales are also found here.
        Killer whales are frequently observed around

      <h4>Brief History</h4>
      <p>
        <img align="right" src="./About/History.jpg" style="width: 20%;" />
        The first known settlers in the Faroe Islands were Irish monks, who in
        the 6th century AD told of the “Islands of the Sheep and the Paradise of
        Birds”.The name of the Faroe Islands first appeared as Føroyar in the
        Faroese language. The Danish name for the Faroe Islands, Færøerne, is a
        reflection of Old Norse terms that likely mean “Sheep Islands.” The
        Faroe Islands were originally inhabited by the Irish monks and then by
        the Vikings in the early 9th century. The Faroe Islands became a part of
        the Hereditary Kingdom of Norway in 1035 and 1380 along with the rest of
        Norway, they were taken over by Denmark. Under the Treaty of Kiel in
        1814, the Danish gained complete authority over the Faroe Islands along
        with Greenland and Iceland. The Faroe Islands became an autonomous
        country within the Kingdom of Denmark in 1948. Today fisheries and
        aquaculture are the basis for the production and export of high quality
        Faroese fish products, which constitute 95 per cent of the total income
        of exported goods. Diversification of the economy and the development of
        a welfare society has led to a variety of working opportunities in the
        modern Faroese society. With economic wealth the Faroese have developed
        a welfare society much along the lines of the typical Scandinavian
        welfare state model, e.g. with free education and healthcare for all.
