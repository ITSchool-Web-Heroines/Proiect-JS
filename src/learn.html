              Over 800 different flavors and smells can be found in each coffee
              bean. Contrary to how our mouths experience flavor, our nostrils
              enable us to distinguish between an incredible range of scents
              (bitter, salty, sour, sweet, umami).
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most frequent mistakes people make while trying to
              develop their taste is ignoring the aroma of coffee. Since smell
              and taste are closely intertwined, almost all of the complex and
              intriguing flavors found in coffee are connected to the scent of
              the cup.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most difficult, yet most rewarding, steps you can take
              to improve your coffee tasting is to take the time to enjoy the
              complexities of coffee aroma.
            </p>

          <div class="about-text">
            <p>
              Coffee's body is simple to imagine, but maybe not so simple to
              see. The tool you use to evaluate your body is your palate, or
              roof of your mouth. And when attempting to depict the body, milk
              is a useful analogy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The taste of skim milk is milder than that of whole milk. Coffee
              with a heavy body will therefore feel heavier than coffee with a
              light body. Variety, roasting, and brewing techniques are
              important.
            </p>
            <p>
              A coffee cupper views the coffee's body as a measure of its
              intensity in terms of weight, the sense of richness that the
              freshly brewed coffee imparts, and its heft. Although this is
              often regarded as a good thing, some people find the "grit" or
              "oilyness" of some coffees to be unpleasant and really prefer
              smooth, filtered coffees.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-text">
            <p>
              It only takes three words to explain this frequently misunderstood
              coffee attribute. Imagine something that is bright, clear, and
              clean. Coffee's acidity is comparable to that of a fine, dry wine.
              It is quite gratifying. Without acidity, coffee usually tastes
              flat and tasteless.
            </p>
            <p>
              As you may expect, coffees from various growing climates or plant
              species will have varying levels of acidity. When you can identify
              the snappy, sharp, wine-like undertone that is the hallmark of a
              superb coffee. You will find out that there is a high or
              well-defined acidity present.
            </p>
            <p>
              Acidity genuinely describes the fruity and tangy characteristics
              of coffee. Delicate acidity in coffee is seen as a favorable
              attribute and an indicator of great quality. It adds complexity,
              brightness, and freshness to the beans.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-text">
            <p>
              One of the key criteria used to assess any coffee is sweetness,
              which can significantly raise a mediocre cup of coffee to a
              terrific one. Sweetness is a moderate, smooth coffee flavor
              sensation that is free of any harsh tastes or flavor flaws.
            </p>
            <p>
              This sweet quality is frequently described as a pleasant or fruity
              flavor that mostly manifests at the tip of the tongue.
              Professionals use the term "sweet" to express the strength of the
              coffee's sugary characteristics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even the most acidic cup of coffee can benefit from the addition
              of sweetness, which makes it luscious and pleasant. The sweetness
              of the coffee also allows the other elements of the cup to shine
              through and creates an easy finish for the taster.

          <div class="about-text">
            <p>
              Bitterness is a dominant flavor sensation, sometimes described as
              a twinge or aftertaste, that is largely felt on the soft palate in
              the back of the tongue and is caused by a mixture of quinine,
              caffeine, and other alkaloids.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the four fundamental tastes, along with tartaric acid,
              sugar, sodium chloride, and bitterness (quinine), is tasted in the
              back of the mouth. In some cases, bitterness in coffee is desired,
              especially in dark roast espresso.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coffee beans of the Robusta variety are often bitterer than
              Arabica coffee beans. A well-balanced bitterness in coffee may
              increase the fullness of its flavor and produce an appealing
              taste.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-text">
            <p>
              Just as significant as the first flavor is the coffee's finish or
              aftertaste. While the first sip of coffee gives the drinker a
              chance to form an initial opinion of the cup and prepares the
              mouth for subsequent tastes, the finish is what really sticks with
              us since it lingers even after the last sip.
            </p>
            <p>
              With possible undertones of caramel, fruitiness, smokiness,
              roastiness, and other flavors, aftertastes might range from
              chocolaty to carbony, turpeny to spicy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The perfect cup of coffee should have a crisp, clear finish that
              stays faithful to the fundamental tastes generated by its
              attributes. A well-balanced coffee is one in which no single
              flavor characteristic dominates or overpowers the others.

          It is only through roasting that the beans acquire the typical brown
          color associated with coffee. Within the first few minutes, fruit
          acids are formed, which are increasingly reduced according to the
          roasting time. This means that the longer the coffee bean is roasted,
          the less acidic the end product. Longer roasting intensifies both the
          color and the taste of the beans. Longer roasting of the coffee
          results in more intense color and flavor in the beans, giving espresso
          its signature bittersweet flavor.

              A light roast can be closer to your taste if you don't like really
              strong coffee. Compared to other roasts, light roast coffee beans
              are roasted for the shortest period of time. White coffee beans
              would be the lightest roast. Due to the coffee's lighter brown
              color and lack of surface oil, cinnamon roast is occasionally used
              to define it. A shorter roasting period also results in a higher
              acidity and caffeine concentration, but a mild fragrance. A thin,
              moderate cup of coffee results from this, having a delicious and
              fragrant flavor.

              Medium brown in color, with a balance of acidity, flavor and
              aroma, medium roast coffee has a richer texture than light roast.
              It also does not have the oily finish found in darker roasts. With
              a medium roast, the nutty, chocolaty flavors of the beans come out
              better. Medium roasts are considered to have a balanced flavor.
              The acidity and body of a medium roast can vary, but are usually
              somewhere in the middle. They have slightly more body than a light
              roast and less acidity.

              If you want to upgrade your coffee in terms of body and flavor,
              medium-dark roasted coffee beans offer a strong body and rich
              aroma with a slightly bittersweet aftertaste. With a medium-dark
              roast, you can enjoy flavors like bittersweet dark chocolate and
              dark roasted almonds. Medium-dark roast lovers are usually fans of
              the French Press, espresso and aeropress brewing methods. If you
              use a French press, grind the coffee coarsely so it doesn't become
              too bitter from over-extraction.

            <p class="roast-text">
              Dark roasts are characterized by a particularly strong body and a
              heavy mouthfeel, which is preferred by many coffee lovers. The
              long roasting time brings out the oil of the bean, which can be
              seen in the brew, and creates a strong, sometimes bitter flavor.
              Dark roasts have a sweeter flavor because the sugar in the coffee
              beans has time to caramelize. The longer roasting process helps
              the coffee develop a richer flavor and full body, often resulting
              in a buttery finish. They also have the lowest acidity of all
              coffee roasts. Dark roasts have the lowest caffeine content
              because they are roasted the longest.
